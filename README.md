# 🌌 AstraGeek. Star maps

This is a project for AstraGeek astronomy online school.
Here you can find some software for building star maps.

On the [website](https://skychart.astrageek.ru/) of this AstraGeek project you are able to create classic skycharts and star sky maps.

Also visit [astrageek.ru](https://astrageek.ru/) for educational videos on astronomy and related topics.

## Features

1. Stereographic projection of the entire sky available at specified location and time
2. Pinhole projection for a specific small area of the sky at specified constellation direction
3. You can add various additional reference elements, such as a coordinate grids, coordinate great circles (ecliptic, galactic and celestial equator), cardinal directions, zenith point, and celestial poles.
4. You can add the outlines of all visible constellations, selected constellations, and the names of each visible constellation to the image.

## How to use


**If wou want to generate new maps by yourself, follow the documentation section below**

You can use the ready-made sets of starry sky maps that we have already generated. To do this, you need:

1. Follow the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AfBc7pkqLH_65TMAeXvpzzzqrLcVKNFO?usp=sharing)
2. Download archives with pinhole camera mode maps and skycharts

Inside each folder there are maps of the starry sky with tasks grouped by numbers. 

There are two folders inside the **pinhole_samples** folder:

1. **сonstellations** - maps with a specific central constellation, for each of the 88 constellations
2. **random_sky** - maps with an arbitrary central constellation, 10 examples

The 100 skycharts for random date and place are grouped inside the 
**stereographic_samples** folder.

Each group consists of three files:

1. For a student without planets - _student.pdf_
2. For a student with planets - _student_with_planets.pdf_
3. For the teacher - _teacher.pdf_

Each file consists of two pages: on the first there are tasks for the map, on the second there is the map itself.

The student's file contains only assignments and a "bare" map. The file for the teacher contains all the answers and a completed map.

## Rust backend (workspace)

The repository now includes a Rust workspace with `rust-core` and an Axum-based `backend`.

Project structure:

- `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) - defines members and shared Cargo settings.
- `rust-core/` - domain logic and reusable astronomy engine:
  - star/Messier catalogs and loaders,
  - projection math (stereographic and pinhole),
  - scoring/time utilities and core tests.
- `backend/` - HTTP API service (Axum + SQLx + SQLite):
  - `src/main.rs` - app bootstrap, shared state, route registration,
  - `src/handlers/` - API endpoints (`catalog`, `simulation`, `game`, `export`),
  - `src/db.rs` - database initialization and schema bootstrap,
  - `src/question_factory.rs` and `src/svg_generator.rs` - game logic and render/export helpers.

Runtime defaults:

- backend port: `8080`
- database URL: `sqlite://apex.db` (project root)
